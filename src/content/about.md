<div id="intro">
	<p>I like coding, biotech, info-sec, rap music, photography, and art.</p>
	<p>Currently I am the Lead Software Developer 
	at <a href="https://ranomics.com">Ranomics</a>, building and designing intuitive, 
	reliable, and secure software to help fight cancer. I built and designed the Ranomics web platform, RESTful API with OAuth2, landing page, and various tools and utilities to help our science team.</p>
	<p>I am a firm believer of using the right tool for the job, 
	therefore I am always open to learning new things quicky and deeply to solve new problems. However,
	if I had to choose, here are the tools that I like the most:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Go</li>
		<li>PostgresSQL</li>
		<li>Service Workers</li>
		<li>React</li>
		<li>AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)</li>
		<li>PHP</li>
	</ul>
