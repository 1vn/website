	<p>Currently I am the Lead Software Developer 
	at <a href="https://ranomics.com">Ranomics</a>, building and designing intuitive, 
	reliable, and secure software to help fight cancer.</p>
	<p>I am a firm believer in using the right tool for the job, therefore I am always open to learning unfamiliar things quicky to solve challenging problems. However, if I had to choose, here are the tools that I enjoy using the most:
